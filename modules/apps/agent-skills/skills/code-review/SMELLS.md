# Smell baseline

A fixed set of Fowler code smells (_Refactoring_, ch.3) that applies even when a repo documents nothing. Two rules bind it:

- **The repo overrides.** A documented repo standard always wins; where it endorses something the baseline would flag, suppress the smell.
- **Always a judgement call.** Each smell is a labelled heuristic ("possible Feature Envy"), never a hard violation — and, like any standard here, skip anything tooling already enforces.

Each smell reads _what it is_ then _how to fix_; match it against the diff.

## The smells

- **Mysterious Name** — a function, variable, or type whose name does not reveal what it does or holds. Rename it; if no honest name comes, the design is murky.
- **Duplicated Code** — the same logic shape appears in more than one hunk or file in the change. Extract the shared shape, call it from both.
- **Feature Envy** — a method that reaches into another object's data more than its own. Move the method onto the data it envies.
- **Data Clumps** — the same few fields or params keep travelling together (a type wanting to be born). Bundle them into one type, pass that.
- **Primitive Obsession** — a primitive or string standing in for a domain concept that deserves its own type. Give the concept its own small type.
- **Repeated Switches** — the same `switch` or `if`-cascade on the same type recurs across the change. Replace with polymorphism, or one map both sites share.
- **Shotgun Surgery** — one logical change forces scattered edits across many files in the diff. Gather what changes together into one module.
- **Divergent Change** — one file or module is edited for several unrelated reasons. Split so each module changes for one reason.
- **Speculative Generality** — abstraction, parameters, or hooks added for needs the spec does not have. Delete it; inline back until a real need shows.
- **Message Chains** — long `a.b().c().d()` navigation the caller should not depend on. Hide the walk behind one method on the first object.
- **Middle Man** — a class or function that mostly just delegates onward. Cut it, call the real target direct.
- **Refused Bequest** — a subclass or implementer that ignores or overrides most of what it inherits. Drop the inheritance, use composition.
